## Educational Game Project ðŸŽ®ðŸ“š

For my OOP project, I developed an **educational game** aimed at helping students improve their **math problem-solving skills** in an interactive and engaging way.

The game was built using core OOP principles such as:

- **Encapsulation** for managing player stats and game logic
- **Inheritance** to define different types of enemies and power-ups
- **Polymorphism** to allow flexible game behaviors (e.g., different attack patterns)
- **Abstraction** to organize reusable game components like rendering, input handling, and scoring

Players navigate through challenges where they must answer math questions under time pressure while avoiding in-game obstacles. The goal was to make learning fun and immersive through gamification.
