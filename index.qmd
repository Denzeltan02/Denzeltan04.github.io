# About Me

Hi, I'm **[Your Name]** â€” a curious and creative individual with a passion for learning, building, and exploring new ideas. I'm currently studying [Your Course or Field], and I enjoy working on hands-on projects that blend technology with real-world impact.

In my free time, I like discovering new tools, experimenting with design, and occasionally diving into code or content creation. This site is a space where I document my journey and share things I'm proud of.

Thanks for stopping by!
